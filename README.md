# 🧠 Smart Notes Manager

Smart Notes Manager is a Python-based note management system designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to **create**, **organize**, **search**, and **manage** different types of notes in an efficient and structured way.

This tool is ideal for anyone looking to keep their ideas, to-dos, and reminders well-organized from the command line.
